# The SIMAS Programming Language
*Originally reated by: Turrnut*<br>
**Brought to C, and once again to Objective-C by tuvalutorture.**<br>

License: GPLv3, which is the same as the [original SIMAS repo, which is also licensed under GPLv3](https://github.com/turrnut/simas) and [CMAS](https://github.com/tuvalutorture/simas).

**SIMAS**, which is an acronym for **SIM**ple **AS**sembly, is a dynamically typed, high level procedural programming language  
with a syntax that is inspired by the Assembly programming language.<br>
In SIMAS, each line starts with an instruction, optionally followed by one or more operands, just like Assembly.<br>
To run a SIMAS program, simply run ```./simas <filename(s)>```. <br>
You can also run just ```./simas``` for the SIMAS command line.

Note: Building CMAS requires you to either use a Macintosh / NeXTSTEP computer with Xcode / Project builder installed OR a compiler with GNUSTEP. 

**Additional Notes** <br>
SIMAS is case-sensitive, although instructions and data types are not. <br>

If you want to be polite to SIMAS, you can add `PLEASE` (case-insensitive) and a space character
in front of any instruction (this can be done as many times as you wish). However, SIMAS will ignore your politeness by ignoring `PLEASE`. <br>

For example, `PLEASE PRINTC "Hello!";` and `PRINTC "Hello!";` does the same thing.<br>

#### Extra stuffs to keep in mind:
* All occurences of `\n` within string constants (such as PRINTC) will be replaced with a new line. This also applies to:
    * `\\` - One backslash
    * `\t` - Tab character
    * `\r` - Carriage return (for files and such)
    * `\"` - Quotation mark (inside other quotes)
    * `\;` - Semicolon (used to say a line is not yet ended)
* Operations like `WRITE` or `PRINTC` need quotes to wrap string literals.
* All statements, including function definitions or comments **must** end in semicolons.
* Accessing arguments in functions starts with `$` followed by a number (starting from 1). Ex. `$1`, `$2`, etc.
* Lists are 1-indexed (starts from 1).
* Names starting with `$` are reserved, meaning you may not create a variable, list, function, pointer, or alias starting with `$`, nor can you create a pointer/alias to a reserved name.

**A word of caution** <br>
As of writing this, SIMASJS is not under active development. I will try my best to mark CMAS-only features,
but be warned that most CMAS code may not run correctly on other implementations. <br>

CMAS tries to achieve maximal parity with SIMASJS, and as such supports (nearly) all SIMASJS instructions & behaviour,
but also has its own superset of features & instructions.<br>

The same applies to CMAS and Objective-CMAS, behaviour and instructions have changed, and it should not be assumed that one will behave like the other.

#### Known CMAS-only features (excluding instructions):
* Type coersion - For operations like `ADD`, not all operands need to be `num` type, as their values will be coerced into `num`-compatible values.
* Type assignment - For operations like `ADD`, rather than OPERAND 1 always being `num`, you can set it to any type, and the resulting value of the operation
will be coerced into that new type & assigned to OPERAND 2.
* Indexing w/ vars - When indexing a list, CMAS supports indexing using pre-existing vars. This is not supported in SIMASJS as of writing this.
* ***VERY IMPORTANT!*** Lists passed by value - When calling / returning a function, lists in CMAS are passed by VALUE, not reference. This is different from SIMASJS,
and MUST be kept in mind if attempting to write cross-compatible programs.
* String Literals - In CMAS, String Literals are required to be wrapped in quotation marks (`"`), whilst SIMASJS does not hold this requirement. 
* CMAS is whitespace-insensitive for tokenisation, so instructions may be split by multiple spaces, lines, etc. This differs from SIMASJS, which requires EXACTLY one space per token.
* CMAS supports calling functions from within functions, which is NOT supported by SIMASJS and will often lead to an infinite loop of execution.
* CMAS supports chaining certain instructions, such as `LIST APPC`, allowing you to save lines (and memory) by simply chaining instructions instead of having many independent function calls.

#### Known Objective-CMAS exclusive features:
* Libraries - Objective-CMAS is currently the only known SIMAS implementation to support the inclusion of SIMAS libraries, adding new instructions or types.
* Type addition - Objective-CMAS is not locked to the included types, libraries can add their own types.
* `in` variable - Parameters named `in` (used in place of a standard variable name, but not a constant) will automatically grab input from the user (and coerce if necessary). Hence, this name is also reserved.
