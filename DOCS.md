* Indexing, starting at 1, can be done both via constant numbers and variables. (CMAS only feature)
* Appending may also be chained, where you may append multiple constants/variables at once. (CMAS only feature)
* Accesses may be chained as well, starting at the first index and increasing with every access. (CMAS only feature)
* OPERAND 1: the operation to run
* OPERAND 2: the name of the list to perform the operation on
* All of the list operations:
    * `list new`
        * creates a new list
    * `list appv`
        * append a variable to a list
        * OPERAND 3: data type of the variable(s) (this operand is ignored in CMAS, but must be there to retain structure & compatibility)
        * OPERAND 4+: name of the variable(s)
    * `list appc`
        * append a constant to a list
        * OPERAND 3: data type of the constant(s)

        * update the list item at a specific index with a constant
        * OPERAND 3: the index, starting from 1
        * OPERAND 4: the data type of the constant
        * OPERAND 5: the constant
    * `list del`

        * OPERAND 3: the index of the item, starting from 1
    * `list acc`
        * access one or more items from a list and store them in one or more variables
        * OPERAND 3: the index, starting from 1
        * OPERAND 4+: the name of the variable(s) that you want to store the value(s) in.
    * `list show`
        * print out the entire list to the standard output
    * `list dump`
        * writes a list to a file
        * OPERAND 3: file name
    * `list load`
        * loads a list from a file
        * OPERAND 3: the name of the list you want to store to

    * `list copy` (also can be `COPYL`)
        * copies a list's contents into another list

### Console I/O

#### - print
* print something to the console.
* OPERAND 1: The name of the variable which the information is stored

#### - printc
* print a constant to the console.
* OPERAND 1: The constant being printed

#### - println
* print a new line

#### - prints
* print a space
* This is useful in cases where you may need to print something right after using ```print```.

### Functions
Note: Unlike labels, functions must be defined prior to use.

#### - fun
* define a function.
* OPERAND 1: The name of the function
* OPERAND 2: The amount of arguments accepted by the function. 
* Arguments will appear as $[arg number], starting from 1.

#### - call
* call a function
* OPERAND 1: The name of the function of which to execute
* OPERAND 2 (and every even-numbered operand hereon): Only needed if function takes args. The type of data that the arg passed is. V for a pre-existing variable, L is for a pre-existing list, 
B for a boolean constant, N for a NUM constant, P for a POINTER to a variable, A for an ALIAS to a list, and S for a string constant.
* OPERAND 3 (and every odd-numbered operand hereon): Only needed if function takes args. The data of the passed argument.

#### - end fun
* signals the end of a function (must be included)

#### - ret
* breaks out of a function
* Important: you MUST call this to break a function, else it will repeat endlessly.
* OPERAND 1: Optional, the type of data being returned. V for a pre-existing variable, L is for a pre-existing list, B for a boolean constant, N for a NUM constant, and S for a string constant.
* OPERAND 2: Optional, but required if OPERAND 1 is present, and is the data being returned. This is shown in a $\[function name\] variable.

### Misc instructions

#### - @ (comment)
* all code after @ in the current line is ignored. comments must also end in a semicolon.

#### - not

* OPERAND 2: the name of the variable
* OPERAND 3: the value you wish to assign, if not using "in" as OPERAND 1. If using "in' as OPERAND 1, this is instead optional, and is the number of characters accepted (255 if unspecified).

* Note 2: import file pathing is relative to where you are RUNNING SIMAS from, NOT where your SIMAS file is.
* OPERAND 1: the file path
